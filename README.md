🗾Japan Tourism Data Analysis / 日本の観光データ分析
📖 Project Overview / プロジェクト概要
As someone with a deep interest in Japanese culture and its growing global appeal, I undertook this project to analyze Japan's international tourism data. The goal is to leverage data science techniques to uncover key trends, identify the primary countries of origin for visitors, and visualize these findings in an insightful manner. This project serves as both a demonstration of my technical skills and a personal exploration of the factors contributing to Japan's vibrant tourism industry.

📊 Key Visualizations / 主な可視化
Interactive World Map of Visitors
A central feature of this project is an interactive choropleth map that visualizes the global distribution of visitors to Japan. The color intensity of each country corresponds to the number of tourists, offering an immediate and intuitive understanding of the data.

Top 10 Visitor Countries
(To generate this image, save the "Top 10 Countries" bar chart from the notebook as a PNG file named top_10_countries.png and place it in the root of the repository.)

🛠️ Technologies Used / 使用技術
Python: Core programming language for the analysis.

Pandas: Used for high-performance data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Employed for creating informative static visualizations.

Plotly: Utilized for generating the interactive and dynamic choropleth world map.

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab: Served as the integrated development environment for code, visualizations, and narrative text.

⚙️ Installation and Setup / インストールと設定
To run this project and reproduce the analysis on your local machine, please follow these steps:

Install Dependencies:
It is recommended to create a virtual environment. Then, install the required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

Launch the Notebook:
Open the .ipynb notebook file in a Jupyter environment or upload it to Google Colab.

Run the Analysis:
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially. The required data file (CSV_1_2_2_.CSV) is included in this repository and will be loaded automatically.

📈 Key Findings / 主な分析結果
Strong European Presence: The analysis indicates that European countries represent the most significant portion of international visitors in this dataset, suggesting strong cultural and economic ties.

Leading Source Nations: France, Spain, and the USA emerge as the top three source countries for tourism to Japan. This highlights the importance of Western markets to Japan's tourism strategy.

Concentrated Visitor Sources: A tiered analysis shows that while Japan attracts visitors from a diverse range of countries, the majority of tourists originate from a smaller, more concentrated group of nations.

🚀 Future Work / 今後の課題
Time Series Analysis: Incorporating historical data would enable a time-series analysis to identify growth trends, seasonality, and the impact of global events on tourism.

Economic Impact Analysis: Integrating data on tourist spending could facilitate an analysis of the economic contribution of visitors from different countries.

Predictive Modeling: With more extensive data, a predictive model could be developed to forecast future tourism numbers based on various economic and social factors.
